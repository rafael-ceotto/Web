This is a repository with some published websites, most of them in portuguese. They follow a clean concept and are simply used for portfolio now,
especially because they belong to the respective company. Please, respect the rights. 

This is also not the final website or can be moved to a different directory since its been a long time but feel free to access and see some of my initial work and how I got into the area.

Some of the programming and markup language used here were: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery and PHP. 

Also, some of the websites were developed from a Wordpress, a CMS tool based on themes. These CMS websites are, in most cases, created using pre-build themes but it's also possible
to create one from the scratch.

For the Zelda theme website, it was a personal project that allowed me to go back on a few concepts that are useful to know when in the world of web development. 

Please, feel free to check the code and let me know if you have any questions.
